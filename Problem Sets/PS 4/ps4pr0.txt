PS 4: Problem 0
Put your response to the reading below.


1. I think there are both pros and cons. First, for pros, there are going to be works that robots can replace. Works such as moving heavy objects can have a negative impact on human bodies. However, if robots can replace these kinds of jobs, there will be less human illness from moving heavy objects. For cons, there will be less jobs for our humanities. These days, many jobs requiring simple taks are taken over by robots due to lower cost. If technology develops and robots gets better, there are going to be more jobs that are replace by robots which isn’t really good for humans.


2. Yes I do. Technology have been developing so fast that companies that are little behind others are having a hard time. For example, Nokia was one of the popular companies which sold cell phones. During the early 2000’s everyone thought Nokia was the best and the company will grow bigger in the future. However, since other companies started using big screens and 3g to do internet on phone, Nokia started to fall apart because they couldn’t follow the speed of the development of the phones. Like the examples, I think there are going to be more companies that are going to fall apart by not catching up the speed with other companies.
